# Primitive-Pythagorean-triplets

The project consists in generating primitive Pythagorean triplets and using them in a simple cryptosystem.
During the solution, the racket utility was used and several concepts specific to functional programming
were applied, such as: recursion on the stack and on the queue, functional ones such as map filter, anonymous lambda functions.
During the final stage of the project, a series of anonymous functions were implemented, used to populate searches such as DFS and BFS.
