;; The same TPP tree determined by application
;; transformations T1, T2, T3 can be generated using
;; GH (Gopal-Hemachandra) tuples.
;;
;; For any pair (g, e), the sequence GH is:
;; g, e, g + e, g + 2e, 2g + 3e, 3g + 5e ...
;; For (g, e) = (1, 1) we obtain the Fibonacci sequence.
;;
;; The first 4 numbers in the sequence form the GH quartet:
;; (g, e, f, h) = (g, e, g + e, g + 2e)
;;
;; For such a quartet (g, e, f, h), we define:
;; a = gh, b = 2ef, c = e ^ 2 + f ^ 2
;; and we can prove that (a, b, c) is a Pythagorean triplet.
;;
;; (a, b, c) is the TPP itself, if we add the conditions:
;; g, e, f, h prime between them
;; g odd
;; but you will not need to do such checks,
;; since we have at our disposal an algorithm that generates
;; exclusively TPP.
;;
;; This algorithm is very similar to the one in the stage
;; previous, with the following differences:
;; - the nodes in the tree are quartets, not triplets
;; (from the quartet we obtain a TPP according to the formulas)
;; (ex: (1,1,2,3) => (1 * 3,2 * 1 * 2,1 ^ 2 + 2 ^ 2) = (3,4,5))
;; - we get the next generation of quartets using
;; three transformations Q1, Q2, Q3 for quartets, instead
;; of T1, T2, T3 who worked with triplets
;;
;; Q1 (g, e, f, h) = (h, e, h + e, h + 2e)
;; Q2 (g, e, f, h) = (h, f, h + f, h + 2f)
;; Q3 (g, e, f, h) = (g, f, g + f, g + 2f)
;;
;; The resulting tree looks like this:
;;
;; (1,1,2,3)
;; ______________ | ______________
;; | | |
;; (3,1,4,5) (3,2,5,7) (1,2,3,5)
;; ______ | ______ ______ | ______ ______ | ______
;; | | || | || | |
